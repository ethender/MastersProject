Machine Learning Project
<h3>Task1: Data pre-processing and data exploration</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Loading the data</li>
		<li>Finding the pattern</li>
		<li> Showing scatter plot and box plot</li>
		<li> Dividing the data to Training Set and Test set </li>
	</ol>
</p>
<br />
<h3>Task2: Do a principal component analysis</h3>
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Perform a PCA analysis on the original training data set.</li>
	<li>Plot a scree plot to report variances captured by each principal component.</li>
	<li>Project the test set on the same PCA space produced by the original training dataset. </li>
	<li>Plot two subplots in one figure: one for the training data in the PC1 and PC2 projection space and
label the data in the picture according to its class; the other one for the test data in the same PCA space and label the data in the picture according to its class.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Task 3: Naïve Bayes Classification model</h3>
<p>
        Do a classification using the Naïve Bayes Classification model
    <ol><li>Train the model using the original training set and report the performance on the test set including accuracy rate.</li></ol>
</p>
<h3>
  Task 4: Select Features for model predicting
</h3>
<p>
  <b>Investigate how the number of features in the training dataset affects the model performance on the validation set</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the training set (II) to train 13 Naïve Bayes Classification models, with 13 different feature sets. That is: the first one is to use the 1st feature only; the second one is to use the 1st and the 2nd features; the third one is to use the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd features, the fourth one is to use the first 4 features, and so on.
Measure the accuracy rate on both the training set and the validation set. Report the results by plotting them in a figure: that is, a plot of the accuracy rate against the number of features used in each model. There should be two curves in this figure: one for the training set (II); the other one for the validation set</li>
    <li>Report what is the best number of features you would like to use in this work and explain why you choose it. Write it down in your Jupyter notebook </li>
    <li>Use the selected number of features to train the model and report the performance on the test set</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>
Task 5: Report The Findings.
</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Summarize your findings, write your conclusions using critical thinking (no more than 100 words) and write it down in your Jupyter notebook</li>
	</ol>
</p>
