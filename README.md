<h3>Task1: Data pre-processing and data exploration</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Loading the data</li>
		<li>Finding the pattern</li>
		<li> Showing scatter plot and box plot</li>
		<li> Dividing the data to Training Set and Test set </li>
	</ol>
</p>
<br />
<h3>Task2: Do a principal component analysis</h3>
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Perform a PCA analysis on the original training data set.</li>
	<li>Plot a scree plot to report variances captured by each principal component.</li>
	<li>Project the test set on the same PCA space produced by the original training dataset. </li>
	<li>Plot two subplots in one figure: one for the training data in the PC1 and PC2 projection space and
label the data in the picture according to its class; the other one for the test data in the same PCA space and label the data in the picture according to its class.</li>
</ol>
